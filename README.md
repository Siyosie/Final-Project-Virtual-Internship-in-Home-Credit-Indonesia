# Default Risk Prediction
The default risk Prediction project will explain the workflow for assessing a client, able to pay were not turned down using a machine learning model. The purpose of making this prediction is to help Home Credit to determine that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a good principal, maturity, and repayment calendar.
